We are making a “Web-Based application” using PHP and MySQL. Our Project title is “Society Visitor Management System”,providing the functionality of entering the visitor records (DATA) into the database.
Visitor Gate Pass System provides a way to effectively control, records and find the organization’s visitors. It helps waiting time of visitor in premise. The GUI provided in our system is so far the nice
feature, providing the easiness to various user in using our system efficiently, fluently. By using our system, the employee working in the premises will also feel safe increasing the level of security.

As the time progresses, the demand of the user also increases in the society. With lots of security feature into the system. Referring to the early times, 
a person has to use a pen and write all the details of the visitor entering into the premises resulting into lots of difficulty. The main drawback is, 
it was failing to provide the key security feature such as authentication whether the user is really coming with good intent and authorization whether the user entered is having the right access into the premises.
So, to overcome all these our project “Society Visitor Management System” will be very useful. Providing the easy way to enter the visitor records information into the database.
The necessary problem of implementing the authentication and authorization feature will also be accomplished. Our system could be used by any society, as it is fully cross platform and efficient with GUI feature enabling user to use our system.
Our system will also reduce the load of the I/C person or the user which is responsible for the new entry of the visitor.
